		<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_Shepherd_Dog#History">
			<h5>The Caucasus Mountains are home to many of the oldest living molosser landrace dogs,
			<br>
			such as the Azerbaijani Volkodav, Azerbaijani Shepherd Dog and Georgian Shepherd
			Dog.
			<br>
			During the 20th century the Soviet breeders selected some of
			these varieties among Caucasian
			<br>
			dogs and created the Caucasian Shepherd Dog breed.
			The modern show class Caucasian
			<br>
			Shepherd is a hybrid of established Caucasian
			types, fundamentally based on the Georgian
			<br>
			Shepherd Dog, which is the largest and most
			muscularly built dog with attractive long hair.</h5>
